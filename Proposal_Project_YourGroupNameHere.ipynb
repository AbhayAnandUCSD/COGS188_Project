    "You have the choice of doing either (1) an AI solve a problem style project or (2) run a Special Topics class on a topic of your choice.  If you want to do (2) you should fill out the _other_ proposal for that. This is the proposal description for (1).\n",

    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like 8-Queens or a small Traveling Salesman Problem or similar\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem (e.g., RL) that interacts with a simulator or live task, then the problem will have a reasonably complex action space. For instance, a wupus world kind of thing with a 9x9 grid is definitely too small.  A simulated mountain car with a less complex 2-d road and simplified dynamics seems like a fairly low achievement level.  A more complex 3-d mountain car simulation with large extent and realistic dynamics, sure sounds great!\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem that uses a dataset, then the dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "- The project must include some elements we talked about in the course\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your AI system. Generally RL tasks may require a huge amount of training, so extensive grid search is unlikely to be possible. However expoloring a few reasonable hyper-parameters may still be possible. \n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "The goal of this project is to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) Classifier on autonomous vehicles. We plan to use DonkeyCar Simulator to navigate the \"Warren Feild\" track and collect our data. The data we plan to collect includes visual input from the front-facing camera, speed and steering angle change. These will be collected during training in the simulated environment. We implement and compare two deep RL algorithms: Actor-Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), both designed for continuous action spaces. Moreover we plan to include a simple Q learning model to show how inefficient/ ineffective it is for more complex problems. We will use the gathered data to train agents to take optimal actions such as steering left/right, acceleration, and braking based on the cars current position. Performance will be evaluated using key metrics such as cumulative reward, lap completion time, and DonkeySim's own accuracy rating. By comparing these metrics across different models and training scenarios, we aim to determine which RL method provides the most robust and efficient control for autonomous driving in simulated environments."
